The signal amplitude of a point source is denoted as $s_i(t)$ . 

Given that the signal arrives at the antenna array as a planar wave front, the signal seen by each sensor differs solely by a phase shift:


$$
x_i(t) = e^{j\varphi_i}   s_i(t) e^{j\omega t}
$$
Relative to the origin the phase delay, as seen by ith-sensor, can be formulated as:

$$
\varphi_i = \vec{k} \cdot \vec{r}_i
$$
$\vec{k}$ is the [[Wave Vector]] and $\vec{r}_i$ is the position of the array element.

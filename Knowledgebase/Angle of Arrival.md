The signal amplitude of a point source is denoted as $s_i(t)$ . 

Given that the signal arrives at the antenna array as a planar wave front, the signal seen by each sensor differs solely by a phase shift:


$$
x_i(t) = e^{j\varphi_i}   s_i(t) e^{j\omega t}
$$
If the phase delay delay is given relative to the wave seen at the origin of the coordinate system, it can be formulated as:

$$
\varphi_i = \vec{k} ...
$$
$\vec{k}$ is the [[wave vector]]

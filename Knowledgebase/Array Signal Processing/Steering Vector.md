The steering vector is a concept used in array signal processing. It describes the phase shift that would be observed for a planar wave front received from a source at an angle of $\theta$ at a given receive antenna that. 

$$
\vec{a}(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} 
e^{\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r}_1} \\
e^{\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r}_2} \\
\vdots\\
e^{\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r}_M} \end{bmatrix}
$$
$\vec{k}$ is the [[Wave Vector]] and $\vec{r}_m$ the position of the m-th receive antenna.

##  Example 2D 
In the case of two dimensions, the wave vector for a planar wave with wavelength $\lambda$ , that impinges on the antenna array from an angle of $\theta$ is 
$$
\vec{k} =  -\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}  
\begin{bmatrix} sin(\theta) \\ cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}
$$

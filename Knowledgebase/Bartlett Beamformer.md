The signal from the i-th antenna at the location $\vec{r}_i$ is assumed to be 
$$
x_i(t) = s(t)e^{\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}_i}
$$
$s(t)$ is the waveform as observed at the origin.

The idea is to form a number of beams into candidate directions and look for the direction with the maximum input power. The output for a given beam is
$$
y_n(t)=\begin{bmatrix} \end
$$

$$
\frac{1}{T} \int (\sum )^2 dt
$$

The wave vector $\vec{k}$ is used to describe the propagation of a plane wave front. The vector is always perpendicular to the plane of the wave front and points into the direction of travel. The magnitude of $\vec{k}$  is the waves angular frequency:
$$
|\vec{k}| = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

##  Example 2D 
In the case of two dimensions, the wave vector for a planar wave with wavelength $\lambda$ , that impinges on the antenna array from an angle of $\theta$ is 
$$
\vec{k} =  -\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}  
\begin{bmatrix} sin(\theta) \\ cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}
$$
